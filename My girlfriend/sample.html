Happy birthday to my beloved girlfriend Aica Fuentes, this is the time you waiting for, your 18 birthday. I'm sorry I can't meet in person because of busy our schedules in school, church becoming a member of the Church of Christ, and doing house duty too. I am blessed and thankful for our Almighty God that you give to me and my life. I always pray for health and love for us in our daily lives. Sometimes we fight together because of jealousy of the other person, but we always forget together, and we can't pass the night to the problem is fixed us. I'll admit that sometimes I'm jealous of other people who approach you to take pictures and spend time with you, but I still have faith in you. No matter what problems and trials come in our lives, I promise you that I will marry and love only you. I will never get tired of loving you if I ever give my life to show that I love you so much I will do it I am ready to give it without a second thought. My love, princess of my life, I will never get tired of saying that I love you so much. No matter what happens to us in life, my love, princess of my life, don't give up the fight, I'm right here by your side, no matter what life's trials come, I will never leave you or leave you, I promise. Whenever I have a problem, you are there, ready to listen and advise me on what to do and what to do, especially in my severe problems in life. Every time I talk to you, I forget my problems in life and my thoughts in life regarding studying. Even if we only have to talk two or three times because of what we do in life, studying, and fulfilling our duties in the chapel. That's fine with me, my princess. I promise you that the day has come when I will be the father of our children. I will be a good husband to you even if my body is tired from working all day, I will help you with household chores. I will cook you delicious food and your favorite food, even though I don't know how to cook haha there is a recipe book to teach me how to cook hehe. We will always watch Chinese drama and Korean dramas even if it's early in the morning to watch it hehe. I promise you, my cute princess, we will go to that place of your dreams. It's not just a dream anymore, we can tell each other that we've been to that place. I will always scold you until we are old enough to dance happily as if we don't think about any problems in life. We will always fulfill our duties in the chapel together. I will always remind the one next to us. I will always pamper you even with my simple or big gift to you, to see that you are happy. I'm happy every time I see you happy and smiling. The day of marriage has come for us, life promises to you, that everything we love in life will be complete, starting from your oldest brother to your youngest brother, friends, and those close to us, life will go my love. Even if I lose my voice just to say that I love you so much, remember this, princess of life, in my heart and mind, I will never get tired of saying that I love you so much. There are no words that I love you so much and I love you, my love. I love that the two of us will always sing the song Laan (wedding inc song) while sitting on our rocking chair while we watch our grandchildren one day. In every lyric of the song of Laan, we will both cry because of the problems we have experienced in life that we have both overcome with a strong relationship.We will remind and look back on the happy memories that we are old in the chair.We will both sing it with all our hearts day and night my princess. My heart rejoices. Because it is ready to beat again. For you, my love. So eager to meet you when you are mine. I hope I can join you too. I wish you were destined for me. I will wait for the right time. Even a few hours, days, weeks, months, or years. No matter how long you wait patiently. Your arrival. I hope God will give you to me. Don't worry, don't be impatient If heaven takes a long time to respond. As I have been asking for a long time. That you are mine to be with. Hope to join you too. I wish you were destined for me. I will wait for the right time. Even a few hours, days, weeks, months, or years. No matter how long you wait patiently. Your arrival. I hope God will give you to me. Don't worry, don't be impatient. If heaven takes a long time to respond. As I have been asking for a long time. That you are mine to be with. Hope to join you too. I wish you were destined for me. In waiting, I promise. My heart will not tire. When you are there, you are my prayer. You and I, we're going to the end. I will wait for the right time. Even a few hours, days, weeks, months, or years. No matter how long you wait patiently. Your arrival. I hope God will give you to me. Don't worry, don't be impatient. If heaven takes a long time to respond. As I have been asking for a long time. That you are mine to be with. Hope to join you too. I wish you were destined for me. No matter how long I will wait for you. I hope God will give you to me. To this day I can't believe that we have been in our relationship for one year, my love. Like before we crush it other today we are one year in our relationship. I wish you don't change. Don't think that you are ugly, the truth is that your beauty is very beautiful like a flower in the garden. Don't give up right away, just fight and fight my love. I promise until the end of my life I will only marry you in front of God inside the chapel. That I will promise to the face of God in sadness, and joy to be with you, I am yours. Just be patient, my princess, we will meet again. We will be attached a vow and prayer to God. Sometimes you suddenly change your attitude. Even so, I still love you, my love. Even before time and the world change, I promise I will only love you, my love. Happy happy birthday lab lab, princess of my life, babe, baby cute, abnoy hehe. Stay enjoy your birthday lab lab.
